Juicer Protocol is a lending protocol which offers guaranteed better rates for both borrowers. It connects with all known DeFi lending protocols to provide the best interests rates.

When a lender deposit money, the protocol automatically chooses the offer with the highest rate. 

When borrower comes, the protocol takes money from lending provider with the lowest interest rate and credit them to borrower, taking a collateral.

The difference between borrowing and deposit rates is distributed between lenders, borrowers & protocol governance.
